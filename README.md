ECE 20007 Circuit Design Project Files

Contains schematics and report of ECE 20007 Basic Circuits Lab final project completed by Brendan McLaughlin and Derek Crocker.

Project objective:  Create audio equalization circuit capable of separating a singular input signal into low (<320Hz), medium (320Hz - 3200Hz), and high (>3200Hz) frequencies, adjusting the level to which each will be present in the output signal, recombining these frequencies and adjusting the overall volume of the output signal, and amplifying the signal so that it has enough power to drive a speaker.  Numeric specifications are available in the file 'Project Deliverables.'  The circuit designed to fulfill these specifications uses breadboard-compatible circuit components such as amplifiers and variable resistance potentiometers, and was then constructed on a physical breadboard to test the effectiveness of the design.  All test results of the final construced circuit are available in the file 'Final Report.'
